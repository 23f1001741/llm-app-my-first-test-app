# Welcome Webpage

## Project Overview

This project is a simple webpage designed to greet visitors with a welcoming message. The page features a vibrant blue background with a bold, centered "Welcome" message, ensuring that the user's attention is focused on the greeting. The webpage is designed with aesthetics and simplicity in mind, leveraging modern web standards and responsive design principles to deliver a uniform experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## How It Works

The webpage is implemented using HTML and CSS. The HTML portion sets up a basic webpage structure with a `<head>` section where the page's metadata and styles are defined, and a `<body>` section that contains the content displayed to the user. The style is written directly within a `<style>` tag, embedded in the `<head>`. 

- **HTML Structure**: 
  - The document type declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.
  - The `<html>` element encloses all content, specifying the `lang` attribute for accessibility and search engine optimization.
  - The `<head>` section includes the character set, viewport settings for responsive design, and the title of the document.
  - The `<style>` section defines the visual styling applied to the `<body>`.

- **CSS Styling**:
  - The `body` tag is styled to have a blue background color (`background-color: blue`) and white text color (`color: white`), ensuring high contrast for readability.
  - Flexbox is utilized (`display: flex`) to center the content both vertically and horizontally within the full viewport height (`height: 100vh`).
  - The margins are removed (`margin: 0`) and a clean font is selected (`font-family: Arial, sans-serif`) for a modern, polished look.

This straightforward use of HTML and CSS results in a clean, engaging webpage suitable for introductory or greeting purposes.
